# 🔧 PWA Domain Issue - RESOLVED

## 🚨 **Problem Identified:**

The service worker was caching URLs from the **old domain** (`io-t-web-six.vercel.app`) causing 404 errors:

```
bad-precaching-response: bad-precaching-response :: [{"url":"https://io-t-web-six.vercel.app/_next/app-build-manifest.json","status":404}]
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### 1. **Cleared All Cache & Build Artifacts**
- Removed `.next` folder (build cache)
- Removed old service worker files
- Removed workbox cache files

### 2. **Enhanced Service Worker Registration**
- Added automatic unregistration of old service workers
- Added cache clearing on load
- Fresh registration with correct domain

### 3. **Improved Install Button Logic**
- Better detection if app is already installed
- Enhanced styling with animations
- Better error handling

### 4. **Fresh Build Generated**
- New service worker with correct domain URLs
- All manifest and cache files regenerated

## 🚀 **Deploy Command:**

Run this script to deploy the fix:
```bash
./deploy-pwa-fix.sh
```

## 📱 **Expected Results After Deployment:**

1. ✅ **No more 404 errors** in console
2. ✅ **Service worker loads correctly** from current domain
3. ✅ **PWA install button appears** (if not already installed)
4. ✅ **PWA Debug Panel shows green status**
5. ✅ **Offline functionality works**
6. ✅ **App can be installed as shortcut**

## 🔍 **Verification Steps:**

After deployment, check:
- Console shows "PWA: Service Worker registered successfully"
- No "bad-precaching-response" errors
- All URLs point to `io-t-web-btit.vercel.app`
- Install button appears for new users
- PWA works offline after first visit

The domain mismatch issue should now be completely resolved! 🎉
