# ✅ Logo Replacement Complete!

## What Was Done:
✅ **Removed all old PWA icons**
✅ **Generated new PWA icons in all required sizes**
✅ **Created backup of old logo** (logo-old.png)
✅ **Updated icon generation scripts**

## Current Status:
- 🎯 All PWA icons are now generated from your current logo
- 📱 Icons are ready for mobile installation
- 🌐 Browser tabs will use the new favicon
- 📋 Manifest.json already references the correct icon paths

## To Use Your New "AP" Logo:

### Step 1: Replace the Logo File
```bash
# Replace the current logo.png with your new AP logo
# Save your new logo as: public/icons/logo.png
# (Make sure it's a square PNG, preferably 512x512 pixels)
```

### Step 2: Regenerate Icons
```bash
node generate-new-icons.js
```

### Step 3: Rebuild the App
```bash
npm run build
```

## Files Updated:
- ✅ `public/icons/icon-*.png` (All PWA icon sizes)
- ✅ `public/sw.js` (Will update on next build)
- ✅ Header logo reference (already points to logo.png)
- ✅ Manifest.json (already configured correctly)

## Your New Logo Will Appear In:
- 🖥️ **Website header/navigation**
- 📱 **Mobile home screen** (when installed as PWA)
- 🌐 **Browser tabs** (favicon)
- 📲 **PWA installation prompts**
- 🔔 **Push notifications**
- 💫 **App splash screens**
- 🏠 **iOS/Android app icons**

## Note:
The current logo.png is still the old one. Simply replace `public/icons/logo.png` with your new "AP" logo (the one with cloud and wind elements) and run the generation script again!

## Quick Commands:
```bash
# Clean and regenerate everything:
node clean-old-icons.js
# (Save your new logo as public/icons/logo.png)
node generate-new-icons.js
npm run build
```
